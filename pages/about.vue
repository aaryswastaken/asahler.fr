      <Pgraph>
	I'm Aarys Sahler, a 2nd year CS student. I used to say that I answer stack overflow for fun but I don't got time anymore for this sadly. 
	<br>
	I'm passionate about photography, especially in the context of events and flowers but also other forms of art such as music (I dont practice but I do enjoy listening to it) or danse.
	<br>
	I enjoy sunsets because I find them very pretty :D
